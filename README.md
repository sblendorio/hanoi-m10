# Tower of Hanoi for Olivetti M10
Tower of Hanoi - classic puzzle game written for **Olivetti M10** - in its version of Microsoft BASIC

I wrote this game in 2002, after finding an old **Olivetti M10** in a *flea market*.
At this link you can see a video made by [*Enrico Prinzi*](http://limonity.altervista.org) (in Italian) about this game.
